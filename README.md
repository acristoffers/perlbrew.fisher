This is a fisher plugin to integrate perlbrew with fish. I just copied the code
already in `~/perl5/etc/perlbrew.fish` into the correct
file/folder structure to make it work with fisher and load faster.

To install, run 

```fish
fisher install acristoffers/perlbrew.fisher
```

You still need to install perlbrew (see <https://perlbrew.pl>).
